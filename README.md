S2 QAP3

Question 1
Look at the following output:

When use enters name and age. A function “makeObj()” is called which makes an object by using a “constructor” function “User()” after getting the values from both Name and age fields.
You need to apply necessary style to the form to give it a look as near as possible to the figure above. [Don’t worry about the styling of buttons, as these are coming from Skeleton CSS that is there in the head section]
	You need to write two functions, makeObj() and displayObj() and call them respectively on each button’s click event. 
	You need to write a constructor function User() that may accept two parameters “n” and “a”. The constructor function uses this n and a to construct a user object and sets up the values inside its own variables. [remember this.name = n; that we did with constructor function]
	BONUS PART: Can you add multiple user objects every time makeObj() is called and use displayObj() to print all of them together. 


Question 2 
	For this part see the json file “users.json” and use this to solve it.
Look at the following:
 
You need to write a function “showJSON()” and attach it with the click of but “Show Json” and it reads the json file from the data folder and displays the record like above picture.
Use XMLHttpRequest to achieve this asynchronously. 

Question 3:
Use following API end point to bring todos list and display it in a presentable format on the page.
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Use Fetch API to achieve this.
